# Setup an On Prem Dev-Ops server from scratch using git-lab

‚úÖ [Prerequisites]()

üíø [Installation]()

‚öôÔ∏è [Configuration]()

## Description

This project consists of the installation and setup of my actual on-prem Dev-Ops
server that I use for open-source project development. It involves the installation,
configuration, and deployment of GitLab using Docker and Docker-Compose.

### Technologies Used

- Docker
- Docker-Compose

### Languages Used

- YAML
-

## Prerequisites

### 1. A server

You can use just about anything for this, one common choice is to use an old
office tower for the purpose of a home server, but in this example we'll be using
my personal server which is a combination of purpose built server hardware and
some more consumer grade elements.

Mine is running nix-os (a Linux distribution), but yours can be running Macos, Linux,
or even openBSD. So long as git-lab is available there's a good chance it'll work.

### 2. Networking

This project is not really about networking, docker networking, or what kinds of
networking you're going to need. If you need more information about configuring your
home-lab network I'd recommend [serve the home]() they have great resources, and
if you're looking for docker networking I'd recommend [this article]() by SOMEGUY.

### 3. An understanding of your operating system and included tools

While I will be walking you through the docker-compose setup, a baseline of
knowledge about your tools is expected. For example, I'll be using a text editor
called vim, but other options like nano, emacs, or notepad would work just as
well just so long as you understand the tools yourself.

## The Installation

### 1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

On debian-based linux, you can install Docker and Docker-Compose with the
following command:
`$ sudo apt install docker docker-compose`

### 2. create /srvs/stacks git-lab stack

Next we're going to create the directory for our docker-compose stacks to live in.
This is often placed in either /opt/stacks/ or /srvs/stacks/. From here on we'll
be refering to this location as ...stacks/ as there are no specific requirements.
In any example code however this will be listed as /srvs/stacks.

Next within .../stacks, create a dir for the docker-compose stack. Our file tree
should now look like this:

- /
  - srvs
    - stacks
      - git-lab

### 3. Create The docker-compose.yaml File

Next we're going to write our docker-compose.yaml. Go ahead and open
`/srvs/stacks/git-lab/docker-compose.yaml` in your favorite text editor
and add the following:

```yaml
version: "3.6"
services:
  gitlab:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
    container_name: git-lab
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
        external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com'
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "2222:22"
    volumes:
      - "/srvs/stacks/git-lab/config:/etc/gitlab"
      - "/srvs/storage/volumes/git-lab/_data:/var/opt/gitlab"
      - "/srvs/stacks/git-lab/logs:/var/log/gitlab"
    shm_size: "256m"
```

### 4. Start the git-lab stack

In the same directory as docker-compose.yaml, enter the following command to
start the container:
`# docker-compose up -d`
The `-d` is to start it in the background, or "disconnected."

## Configuration

For configuration we have two options. You can either write the configuration
options within the container in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb, or you can write them
within the `GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG` inside the docker-compose file.

### Write the Config Inside the Container

First we get a shell inside the container with:
`# docker exec -it git-lab /bin/bash`
and then edit the config file using nano or vim:
`# vi /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`

Now set the `external_url`, smtp settings, and https settings to your preference.

### Write the Config In docker-compose.yaml

My prefered method is to configure containers within docker-compose.yaml, so
lets go through that. First open `docker-compose.yaml`

Now we're going to write the flags to send to gitlab.rb inside our GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG
variable as follows:

```yaml
GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
  external_url 'http://gitlab.willowmarmon.com';
  gitlab_rails['smtp_enable'] = false;
```

There are many other settings you can configure in GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG, and
you can see them all [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/files/gitlab-config-template/gitlab.rb.template)
